1. Summary of Learnings So Far:

Model Viability: HistGradientBoostingRegressor combined with StandardScaler and PCA is a viable approach, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of around ~17.3 cm (both in cross-validation and on the validation set).
Data Representation (Current): Using 60x60 RGB images (load_rgb: True, downsample_factor: 5) provides enough information to reach this ~17.3 cm level, but likely contains significant redundancy or noise.
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Aggressive PCA is crucial for the current setup. The best performance consistently came with a low number of components (settling around 30 components), drastically reducing from the initial 10800 features. Using more components (e.g., 100+) consistently performed worse within the tested training limits.
Training Iterations (max_iter): The model consistently performs best at the maximum number of iterations allowed in the grid search (200 -> 500 -> 1000). This is a strong indicator that the model is likely undertrained and could benefit from even more iterations.
Learning Rate (learning_rate): Lower learning rates (0.05, and now 0.02) seem slightly preferable, which aligns with needing more iterations for convergence.
Tree Complexity (max_leaf_nodes): The optimal value isn't definitively clear but seems to favor moderate complexity (best was 50 in the last run, 31 previously). It doesn't seem overly sensitive between 31 and 50.
Progress: We saw good initial improvement (~18.5 -> ~17.45 cm), but the latest run yielded only marginal gains (~17.45 -> ~17.32 cm), suggesting we might be hitting a plateau with the current specific configuration and hyperparameter ranges.
What We Know About the Dataset/Problem Now:

The relationship between raw 60x60 RGB pixels and distance is complex, but much of the necessary information seems concentrated in a lower-dimensional subspace (captured by the top ~30 PCA components).
Simply adding more PCA components (capturing more variance) doesn't automatically help and can hurt if the model doesn't have enough iterations/capacity to utilize them effectively or if they primarily capture noise relative to the distance task.
The model is sensitive to the number of training iterations, especially with lower learning rates.

Comparison with Previous Summary:

Model Viability: Confirmed. HGBR+Scaler+PCA still works, but the best MAE achieved remained virtually identical (~17.27 cm CV vs ~17.32 cm previously).
Data Representation (60x60): Your previous summary suspected redundancy/noise in RGB. The grayscale experiment tested removing color redundancy. Finding: Removing color did not improve performance at this resolution. The MAE stayed the same or got slightly worse on validation. This suggests color might contain some useful information, or its removal doesn't address the core limitation.
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Aggressive PCA was crucial for RGB (best ~30 components). Finding: Aggressive PCA is still crucial for grayscale (best ~20 components). The optimal number dropped slightly, likely due to the lower initial feature count (3600 vs 10800), but the principle holds strong.
Training Iterations (max_iter): The model maxed out iterations for RGB. Finding: The model still maxed out iterations (best was 2000, the max tested) for grayscale. This reinforces the idea that the model benefits from long training times, regardless of color.
Learning Rate (learning_rate): Low rates (0.02) were best for RGB. Finding: Low rates (0.02) were still best for grayscale. This finding is consistent.
Tree Complexity (max_leaf_nodes): Moderate complexity (50) was best for RGB in the last run. Finding: Moderate complexity (50) was also best for grayscale. Consistent finding.
Progress/Plateau: RGB hit a plateau around ~17.3 cm. Finding: Grayscale did not break this plateau. Performance remained stuck at the same level.
Updated "What We Know About the Dataset/Problem Now":

The relationship between raw pixels (at 60x60 resolution) and distance is complex, with essential information concentrated in a very low-dimensional subspace (captured by the top ~20-30 PCA components).
Simply adding more PCA components beyond this optimal low number doesn't help and can hurt performance, likely due to noise or insufficient training time/model capacity to leverage them.
The model (HistGradientBoostingRegressor) is sensitive to training iterations and benefits from many (2000+), especially with low learning rates (like 0.02).
New: At the 60x60 resolution, color information does not seem to be detrimental, and removing it (using grayscale) does not provide a performance advantage with the current HGBR+PCA approach. The performance bottleneck around ~17.3 cm MAE is not simply due to the presence of color channels.
