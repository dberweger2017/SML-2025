1. Summary of Learnings So Far:

Model Viability: HistGradientBoostingRegressor combined with StandardScaler and PCA is a viable approach, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of around ~17.3 cm (both in cross-validation and on the validation set).
Data Representation (Current): Using 60x60 RGB images (load_rgb: True, downsample_factor: 5) provides enough information to reach this ~17.3 cm level, but likely contains significant redundancy or noise.
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Aggressive PCA is crucial for the current setup. The best performance consistently came with a low number of components (settling around 30 components), drastically reducing from the initial 10800 features. Using more components (e.g., 100+) consistently performed worse within the tested training limits.
Training Iterations (max_iter): The model consistently performs best at the maximum number of iterations allowed in the grid search (200 -> 500 -> 1000). This is a strong indicator that the model is likely undertrained and could benefit from even more iterations.
Learning Rate (learning_rate): Lower learning rates (0.05, and now 0.02) seem slightly preferable, which aligns with needing more iterations for convergence.
Tree Complexity (max_leaf_nodes): The optimal value isn't definitively clear but seems to favor moderate complexity (best was 50 in the last run, 31 previously). It doesn't seem overly sensitive between 31 and 50.
Progress: We saw good initial improvement (~18.5 -> ~17.45 cm), but the latest run yielded only marginal gains (~17.45 -> ~17.32 cm), suggesting we might be hitting a plateau with the current specific configuration and hyperparameter ranges.
What We Know About the Dataset/Problem Now:

The relationship between raw 60x60 RGB pixels and distance is complex, but much of the necessary information seems concentrated in a lower-dimensional subspace (captured by the top ~30 PCA components).
Simply adding more PCA components (capturing more variance) doesn't automatically help and can hurt if the model doesn't have enough iterations/capacity to utilize them effectively or if they primarily capture noise relative to the distance task.
The model is sensitive to the number of training iterations, especially with lower learning rates.
